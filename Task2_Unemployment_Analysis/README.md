# Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate in India, specifically during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I have visualized the socio-economic impact of the 2020 lockdown on the labor market across various Indian states.

## Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information about the labor market in India up to August 2020. Key features include:
- **Region:** The specific Indian states/territories.
- **Date:** The timeline of the data collection.
- **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%):** The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
- **Estimated Employed:** The total number of people currently employed.
- **Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%):** The percentage of the population that is either working or actively looking for work.

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Stripped leading/trailing spaces from column names.
- Renamed columns for better accessibility and professional coding standards.
- Converted date columns into proper datetime formats for time-series analysis.

### 2. National Trend Analysis (Line Chart)
- Created a time-series line plot to observe fluctuations in the unemployment rate.
- **Lockdown Impact:** The visualization clearly marks the drastic spike following the March 2020 lockdown.
- **Findings:** The national unemployment rate reached a staggering peak of **76.74%** during the crisis.

### 3. Regional Insights (Bar Chart)
- Conducted a comparative analysis of unemployment rates across different Indian states.
- **Finding:** **Tripura** emerged as the region with the highest average unemployment rate at **28.35%**, indicating significant regional economic distress.

### 4. Correlation Analysis (Heatmap)
- Generated a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables.
- **Validation:** Confirmed a strong negative correlation between the number of 'Employed' individuals and the 'Unemployment Rate', validating the integrity of the dataset.

### 5. Distribution & Volatility (Box Plots)
- Used Box Plots to analyze the distribution of unemployment rates and identify outliers across different regions.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and structural analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating high-quality, insightful visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For mathematical and numerical operations.

- ## Conclusion
The analysis successfully demonstrates the severe impact of the pandemic on India's employment sector.
The data highlights that while the entire country suffered, certain regions like Tripura faced 
a much more intense economic challenge during the lockdown period.
